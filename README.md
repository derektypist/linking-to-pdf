# Linking to PDF

Welcome to Linking to PDF.  The purpose is to link a web page to PDF files without leaving the web page.

## UX

As the user hovers over the link, a tooltip appears to let the browser know that the user has hovered over the link.  The colour changes from green to orange.

## Features

Linking to PDF Files without leaving the web page.

## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Testing

All the links are manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.  Links to PDF Files open in a new window without leaving the web page.
